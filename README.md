This login form collects essential student details, including Name, Class, Roll Number, Subjects (selected from multiple options), and Password. Users can select multiple subjects from checkboxes, allowing flexibility for students with various subject enrollments. JavaScript validates each field, ensuring all required details are filled and at least one subject is selected. A sample password check ("12345") grants access, displaying an alert with the entered information if successful. The form is styled simply but effectively, centering on user-friendly interaction and clarity.
